        <h2>A dumb way to troll your friends or check your IP</h2>
        <p>If you came here from that image:<br/>
        <img src="lol.png" width="256"><br/>
        then <b>don't worry!</b> This is just a dumb <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> app that generates that image when needed.</p>
        <p>Feel free to send <a href="lol.png">this link</a> to your friends if you want to screw with them :P<br/>
        Or just save it and use it to check your IP if needed. I won't judge. </p>
