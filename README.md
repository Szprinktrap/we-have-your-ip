# we-have-your-ip
a dumb Express application that shows a meme with your IP to scare your friends

yes i know this code is awful

# why?
i saw a youtube post with similar meme, but with a random (and invalid) ip.
so i thought it would be funny to create something like this

# how do i host this
get a server with a domain or something, install node.js, clone, run `npm i`, then `node .` and enjoy
