# we-have-your-ip
a dumb Express application that shows a meme with your IP to scare your friends

yes i know this code is awful

# what
this thing generates a meme telling you that sonic & co got your ip (showing your actual ip).
when you send it via discord, it just shows a generic "don't open this in browser" shit.

# why?
i saw a youtube post with similar meme, but with a random (and invalid) ip.
so i thought it would be funny to create something like this

# how do i host this
get a server with a domain or something, install node.js, clone, run `npm i`, then `node .` and enjoy.

by default it listens on port 1337, but you can change that easily in index.js. image url will be on `http://your.address.here:port/lol.png`
